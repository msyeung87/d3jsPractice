D3 is embedded within an HTML webpage, the javascript D3.js library uses pre-built javascript functions to select elements, create SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) objects, style them or add transition, or dynamic effects

The objects can be style using CSS

Data visualization is a process of mapping data to visuals. Data in, visual properties out. Maybe bigger numbers make taller bars, or special categories trigger brighter colors. The mapping rules are up to you.

With D3, we bind our data input values to elements in the DOM. Binding is like “attaching” or associating data to specific elements, so that later you can reference those values to apply mapping rules. Without the binding step, we have a bunch of data-less, un-mappable DOM elements. No one wants that.

## SVG elements
#### Scalable Vector Graphics is a text-based image format. Each SVG image is defined using markup code similar to HTML. Every web browser supports SVG except Internet Explorer versions 8 and older.
